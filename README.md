# Social-Media-Project
Python Django Social Media application with Django Rest Framework Backend and Django frontend app

***Html and CSS codes for this app is not mine. I found them on the internet. However, all backend and django parts belong to me***

This project was supposed to be a social media platform specific for gamers. My aim was to connect every game service to this platform and bring them together. All libraries, all friends, all achievements at one place. So far I only connected Steam and I haven't implemented much. When you connect your Steam account your library is copied and when you want to upload a post you can select a game from your library. There are many features I would like to add like displaying inventory or achievements.

This project has 2 applications. It was aimed for web and mobile so I created 2 different apps. One is frontend app that user interacts. Other is a Django Rest Framework with all the APIs. Frontend app uses these APIs to work.

Connect Steam Account<br />
